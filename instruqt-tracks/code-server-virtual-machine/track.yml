  This example track is a starting point for building your own tracks that require an advanced IDE for text and code editing.

  The setup process is all included in the setup-workstation script, which downloads and installs code-server and creates a systemd startup script for it. You may adjust the starting directory that your learners will see in the command line.

  There is also an example of how to install an extension automatically.
