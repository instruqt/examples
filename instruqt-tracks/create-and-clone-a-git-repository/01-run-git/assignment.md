    Git is by far the most widely used modern **version control system** in the world.

    Git does **not** have one **single place** for the full version history of the software as is common in other version control systems **like CVS** or **Subversion** (SVN).
    In Git, **every developer's working copy** of the code is also a **repository** that can contain the **full history** of all changes.

    Git is a **command line** tool which we've **already installed** for you.
    It will already be present **on the PATH**, so just running `git` will be enough to invoke it.
