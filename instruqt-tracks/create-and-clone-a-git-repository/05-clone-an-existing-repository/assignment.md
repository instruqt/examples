üëç Clone your repository
=======================
## Finishing it up

If you already have an existing project hosted remotely you can clone this git repository to your local machine.
In this case we are going to clone a repository from [Github](https://github.com)

Try to clone the following repository: `https://github.com/instruqt/git-hello-world.git`
Once you have this local copy of the repository, all changes to the repository are managed in the local repository.
