We've spun up an AKS cluster and installed the **kubectl** and **helm** commands on your workstation.

The Azure `az` command line tool is also installed and ready to use.

Your AKS cluster name is **instruqt-cluster**.

Go ahead and try running some commands:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You can copy this template and use it as a starting point for your own tracks that require AKS.

Install the Juice Shop ðŸ§ƒ
=========================

Now let's install the Juice Shop application in your cluster with the following commands:

```bash
helm repo add securecodebox https://charts.securecodebox.io/
helm install my-juice-shop securecodebox/juice-shop --version 3.6.0
```

It can take up to 30 seconds for the application to start. Check if the app is ready with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods --watch
```

When you see the `STATUS` change to `Running` the Juice Shop is open for business! Press **CTRL-C** on your keyboard to stop the kubectl command and return to the command prompt.

Expose the port with the following command:

```bash
kubectl --address 0.0.0.0 port-forward service/my-juice-shop 3000:3000
```

Now you can click on the **Juice Shop** tab to see the Juice Shop running.

The OWASP Juice Shop is a sample site used to demonstrate bad and insecure web design!

With Instruqt you can easily install and manage your own Kubernetes application or service.
