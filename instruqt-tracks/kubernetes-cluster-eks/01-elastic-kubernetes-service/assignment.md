    # Nerd Trivia

    The original codename for Kubernetes was "Project 7", a reference to the _Star Trek_ ex-Borg character [Seven of Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_of_Nine). Since K8s was based on Google's internal container engine, "The Borg", it seemed like an appropriate choice.

    Now you know why the Kubernetes wheel has seven spokes!

We've spun up a EKS cluster and installed the **kubectl** and **helm** commands on your workstation.

The cluster name is **instruqt-cluster**.

Go ahead and try running some commands:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You can copy this template and use it as a starting point for your own tracks that require Kubernetes.

If you need to re-authenticate just run the following command:

```bash
aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name instruqt-cluster
```

This will cache your credentials so you can run kubectl and helm commands.
