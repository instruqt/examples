title: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
teaser: An example track that includes an EKS cluster.
description: |-
  This template includes an EKS cluster and a workstation with the **kubectl** and **gcloud** commands preinstalled. Use it as a starting point for your own K8s enabled tracks.
  Note - an EKS cluster takes up to 25 minutes to deploy. You may wish to utilize Hot Start to reduce startup times for your participants.

  **WARNING:** This track is big and expensive to run. Do not make it public or it may be compromised and used for mining cryptocurrency.
