Python Check Scripts
====================
In order to pass this check you need to create a file called `hello.txt` in the `/root` directory.

Try the check button first to see the fail message.

Then create the file with this command:

```
touch /root/hello.txt
```

Now try the check script again. Python is Magic! ðŸª„
